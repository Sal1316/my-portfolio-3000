# My Portfolio 3000

## Description

This is my portfolio. It is where I will showcase my progression from a beginner to a Software Engineer. My motivation for creating this project was to have a place where all my projects can be showcased and accessed. Also, I will Integrate my resume and give it functionality to be able to message me back if there are any queatios.  Building this project was not easy, there was a couple heardles I had to overcome, specifically, when I ran into issues I had to figure them out myself. Some of the minor issues was the bugs and using outdated plugins. Overall, this was a great experiecne, taht I hope will help me to breack into the Software Engineering field.
