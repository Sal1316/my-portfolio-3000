# My Portfolio 3000

## Description

- This is my portfolio where I showcase my progression from a beginner to a Software Engineer. My motivation for creating this project was to have a place where all my projects can be showcased and accessed. Additionally, I will integrate my resume and add functionality for messaging me if there are any questions. Building this project was challenging; I encountered several hurdles, specifically when I faced issues that I had to resolve on my own. Some of the minor issues involved bugs and using outdated plugins. Overall, it was a great experience that I hope will help me break into the Software Engineering field.
